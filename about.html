										<h3>Mission</h3>
									</header>
									<p>We seek to convene the most expansive representation of ancestral knowledge and indigenous science from communities across the globe, in order to highlight the incredible astronomical legacy of our communities and the ways our observations have to led to understanding ourselves. We hope to come together, share and compare our cosmologies, and find the means by which we may all better know our world, and the sky above.</p>

									<header id="vision">
										<h3>Vision</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Our vision is to uplift and celebrate Indigenous ideologies and epistemologies around astronomy, from the cutting edge of astrophysical research to the intricacies of ancient cultural practices around the stars. Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences - for as long as we have been human we have been looking up and wondering what else is out there. There are millennia-long traditions of astronomical study in indigenous communities around the world, and we want to bring together academics from all walks of life to highlight them.</p>

												<tr>
													<td>Academic Excellence</td>
													<td>First and foremost this conference is a showcase for all of the incredible research being done by and with indigenous academics and communities from all career stages.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Inclusivity</td>
													<td>Indigenous researchers are underrepresented across academia. This will be the first and only conference to specifically highlight indigenous astronomy research.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Interdisciplinary Collaboration</td>
													<td> Researchers and community members of any discipline are invited to present at this conference, and we hope that this fosters interdisciplinary collaboration for years to come.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Foster Community</td>
													<td>We hope that this gathering fosters a greater sense of community, especially from early career researchers from indigenous backgrounds, across all of our disciplines.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Community Engagement</td>
													<td>We will be inviting community members to join us as well to discuss the ways in which we can grow healthy community practices around astronomical research.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Impact</td>
													<td>This conference is hopefully the first of a recurring series that gives space to indigenous academics and non-academics who work in astronomy and related fields.</td>
